                <h2>NFTs history</h2>
            </article>
            <article class="textsContents">
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp The NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are a relatively recent innovation in the digital
                    market, but they are
                    already causing a revolution in the way people think about ownership and authenticity. The history
                    of
                    NFTs began with the creation of the blockchain, a secure and immutable digital recording technology
                    that
                    allowed for reliable and permanent recording and verification of transactions.</br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp In 2014, the first NFT was created using the Ethereum blockchain, paving the way for a
                    new way for
                    digital art owners and collectors of virtual items to record and trade their exclusive properties in
                    a
                    secure and reliable manner. Unlike traditional currency, which is fungible, meaning interchangeable
                    for
                    units of equal value, NFTs are unique and unalterable.</br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp Since then, the NFT market has grown rapidly, with collectors and artists selling rare
                    virtual artwork
                    and items for million-dollar values. Additionally, NFTs are also being used to record property
                    rights
                    for games, music, videos, and other types of digital content.</br>

                    &nbsp &nbsp The blockchain technology allows for additional security measures, such as two-factor
                    authentication and
                    cutting-edge encryption, to protect NFT information and transactions. Furthermore, the ease of
                    property
                    verification is another important aspect that makes the NFT market secure and reliable. Anyone can
                    verify the ownership of an NFT on the blockchain, making authenticity verification much easier than
                    in
                    the traditional art market.</br>
                </p>

                    </div>
                </article> -->
                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp In conclusion, the history of NFTs started with the creation of the blockchain and
                    evolved into a new
                    way of recording and trading exclusive properties in a secure and reliable manner. With blockchain
                    technology and additional security measures, the NFT market is a safe choice for digital collectors
                    and
                    artists.
