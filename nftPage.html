            <h1>What is a NFT?</h1>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp Non-fungible tokens (nfts) jumped from the more hidden corners of the internet into the mainstream in March 2021 when the UK-based auction house Christie's sold a digital artwork for $69 million. What it actually whips up is an NFT, a cryptocurrency that certifies that buyers own an intangible token tied to a unique piece of digital art, music, or other item. Like the pipe painted by Ren√© Magritte declaring "this is not a pipe", the nft is not what it stands for. Over the past few months, tweets, basketball dunk videos, and even the source code of the World Wide Web have been sold as NFTs. They generated nearly $11 billion in revenue from June to September, an eightfold increase from the previous four months, according to market tracker DappRadar. What exactly are NFTs? Why do people spend tens of millions of dollars on it?</br>
            &nbsp &nbsp An NFT is a record on a cryptocurrency blockchain (not just an immutable ledger that records virtual coins) that represents a fragment of digital media. It was invented a few years ago and can be associated not only with art but also with text, video or code snippets. Proponents of NFTs claim they solve a thorny problem with digital art: how to own the original. For creators who freely upload their work or sell it as an identical copy, the concept of originality is hard to pin down. Enforcing exclusivity is impossible when digital files can be shared freely on the Internet. But what collectors want is a stamp of quality that goes hand in hand with the exclusivity statement of the artwork. Good for nfts here.</p>
