            <h1>What is the IMPORTANCE of learning PAINTING?</h1>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp Drawing is a full-fledged artistic medium, often incorporating a computer, graphics tablet, and software of your choice. Artists paint and draw using the pens that came with the tablet to create 2D paintings in digital art software. Digital artists use a variety of techniques and tools, the first being digital brushes. These come standard with all digital art programs, but users can create their own by changing their shape, texture, size, and rendering. Many of these brushes are designed to represent traditional styles such as oil, acrylic, crayon, charcoal, and airbrush, but not all. Other effective tools are layers, lasso tool, shapes and masks. Digital painting has evolved in a way that not only mimics traditional art styles, but has become an entirely separate technique.</br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Both amateur and professional artists use painting. Its use is especially widespread in commercial production studios making games, TV, and movies. There are several reasons for this, and this applies to amateurs as well. Digital painting allows artists to easily experiment with different techniques and colors, as the use of layers, undoing and saving files makes it a non-destructive working process. Artists can always restore a previous state in an artwork, so nothing is really lost. This not only saves time, but also material and gives the artist more creative freedom.</p>
